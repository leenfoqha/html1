    <h1>My 3 Favorite Foods</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza</li>
        <p>Pizza is a classic favorite of mine. I love the combination of gooey cheese, savory tomato sauce, and a variety of toppings. Whether it's a simple Margherita or a loaded supreme pizza, it's always a go-to comfort food.</p>
        
        <li>Sushi</li>
        <p>Sushi is a delightful blend of flavors and textures. The freshness of raw fish, the creaminess of avocado, and the bite of wasabi all come together in perfect harmony. It's not only delicious but also visually appealing.</p>

        <li>Chocolate Ice Cream</li>
        <p>Chocolate ice cream is my ultimate dessert. Its rich, creamy, and velvety texture, combined with the deep, indulgent flavor of chocolate, makes it a sweet treat that I can never resist.</p>
    </ul>
